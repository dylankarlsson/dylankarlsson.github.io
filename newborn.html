5/18-19/19

Unwrap the Kinder egg
	& observe the family inside
	their lives about the nest
	tending to
	the birdlings

Capital, has its own special gravity
	pulls us in, quicker
	than we imagined—
	siloed pockets
	in a city

Nature is at work:
	a potted fern
	by cubicle

Bring your child
	to work
	& watch it learn
	one way to end
	the long day/

5/23/19

Healing is not a return
	but a necessary change

Forward looks back
	when we face
	each other
	in meeting

11/11/18 (unhealthy?)

Could u take up the mantle
	and further me? Cite with ink
	of thought, furtive actions

Houseflies of the world conspire
	along with the most miniscule
	of revolutions, we are much slower
	to decay

Under the same moon, wrought
	by the same compulsion to doubt

We share a desire to squash it
	by any means
	fact, fiction, poetry – tools of inquiry
	& destruction

Anything for a flat enough world


5-25-19 (underneath change (unfortunate sonnet))

Any such thing as a worldview is as ears tuned
	to music, to registered noise

Form is a shifting baton, the anchor (could that be us?) 
cannot grasp what had begun

Fruition always comes tho, contingent 
on our resolve to be done with it all

Those were the hungers, the dramas I wore habitual 
as a pendant, a saint native to the imagination

& now I’ve found joy was a floor beneath me

The wage-watered flower grows with much still
	to savor about the ‘essentials’
	like sunlight, touch, and breath

Constant, some remains
	sit underneath change


6-6-19

How destroyed something is – totally
	pulverized – the oil
	added to the shredded
	paper pulp

It’s almost impossible to get rid
	of anything, and yet
	where have these worlds
	gone

A document destroyed
	describes the world
	it left

‘Memories’ in my photo app
	are generated
	for the pleasure
	of memory itself

Set to jingles, a slideshow
	rolled by dice
	undied in my cloud

Can u allow the lived to die,
	what should depart
	the worlds beyond—
	emptied & vacant

6-7-19

U took the old fashioned
	at Bigfoot, I did too

We share the cheers, the sip—
	tippy-top of experience =
	the bright spot
	of memory

The look from here-out
	is dim – w/ fear – like a sieve
	seems to pull part
	from part

The cherry in the glass
	sips from its bath

U share ur vision, shared
	collapse of hope
	future’s nulled
	points

The horizon is impossible
	and always everywhere—
	same as us, one

6-8-19

I pour myself, my time
	like hot sugar
	molten pile

What am I building
	up, the foundation
	of a future house—
	every hand
	conspired
	some memories
	hold stronger
	than others

I think like my commitments,
	act in accordance
	& don’t

I step outta bounds
	think big about
	the smallest self

Like banana brought
	to local shelf

Can u undo the thought
	the room big enough
	to fit everyone in it

6-10-19

A public pool
	holds capacity

6-22-19

The uber driver arrived
	quicker than I could handle
	(one step closer)
	the commute,
	a commitment

All that time, did I compromise
	myself & call it love – stretched
	the cell of memory –

6-24-19 (against training, just for a minute)

I have to believe in naps
	again, in other words
	log the fuck off—
	enough to scrape the sugar
	lerp’s honeydew house from
	a gum tree leaf,
	pause

& unlearn myself –
	competing stories, adversarial
	interests – to feel once more
	a presence
	against all training

What world do I have
	to make… dissolve attention
	away from the timesheet,
	steal time
	in the clock of a lover’s iris

Brought to conclusions
	not of our own –
	taking on water, I’ve been bailing it
	out with enough time to spare –
	to stop
	& remember how good the saltwater
	feels in my shoes

6-29-19 (so long “books,” I’m reading everything)

A vista that’s best
	revisited, the lungs
	receive this air most fully
	pursued by nearest
	truth
*
Fucked up
	ur friends seemed
	to have read every
	word
	w/ a totally different
	perspective :/
*
A note: screenshot only
	the funniest moments—
	what’s important
	should stick around,
	hopefully fyi
*
Loving ur life
	u find everything’s connected
	& who’s that behind it all?
*
Bless the deep red
	sunset, it spills
	bloody on the outlet
	mall’s parking lot—
	like heaven
	under Nike’s check
*
Dad argues
	for tech determinism—
	he always sits in front
	of the desktop
	w/ an Alexa,
	account unlinked
*
It’s all very
	frustrating, I know—
	we cannot wait
	for the new
	to be born,
	we are found
	out – w/ love –
	caught
	in motion
*
Is it a problem
	if I miss u
	too much to remember
	the day?



7-9-19

Fearing the everlasting yawn, the retreat
	to safety behind eyes (inaction)

I want to be present, here with our
	throat coats, alternating under blanket

Like air plant to tree trunk, I cling to you
	& find my home without roots

Where does the seed come from, the room
	behind those haunting curtain calls
	with its light
	its mist blue

	“rootless, you trudge thru the earth
	lighter than the earth’s dream
	the heaviest material known,
	you are tethered and released,
	the only thing there is left
	is choice”

7-15-19 (a/s/l)

I put my aging on record, u can track
	progress by scrolling thru
	my development

Am I already compromised? The networks
	I’ve garnered & been given, the contact
	book is both threat & social safety
	net

I’m exposed now, the face given away
	the interior of childhood bedroom
	the floorpan, my scrobbled interests

No, I said look into my soul
	not its description

U speak to me in verified facts, how
	about a little poetry, sweet nothing

Don’t even type it out, the line is tapped
	keep it bottled up & send over air

The screen hums with warmth, this
	conversation’s got its own host
	where u can bet it’s a lot warmer,
	where words are hotter than most

7-19-19 (no information)

Unsettled awake
	back to a body
	alone, in my throat
	a sore

Unbelieved of
	in a sequence of ideas
	the first to affirm me
	in the window
	the last dew-strewn
	webs remain
	& hang
	heavy as a dream
	forgotten

Eat the morning’s
	pudding, a temporary
	salve no stronger
	than poetry

Each day
	awake into
	the peace of descent
	but fall
	hopelessly
	into pattern

What is it
	the disguise
	of ur ease
	has me
	…ready
	to drop
	all the how’s

No fit
	for the chronic
	pain of min. wage
	where no second
	passes w/o
	its recording

Lucky to be
	for now
	here, w/ no reason
	no information

7-28-19 (garden)

The web that ensnares
	us, also connects
	in asymmetric
	harmony,
	its network effects
	our lucky
	LOCK-IN

There’s no login
	anymore, just the one-
	way revolving door
	the gmail bearing
	your full name

Somewhere
	I opted out
	of poetics, ceding
	language
	to the territory
	of ideas, a property
	gaining value

Being exposed
	to the externalized
	thoughts of others
	has over-saturated
	any ability
	to lead with clarity—
	only worn
	paths into
	a ground
	we know too well

We cannot end
	posturing
	towards love
	figments
	all speculation

It crashes
	the markets
	the leaves of our garments
	all blown away

8-8-19 (tomorrow I will smell the carrion flower)

& remind myself
	that some
	profit off
	the rot

Flighty I
	attend to
	a temporary feast
	w/ such delight
	an observer
	to the chaos
	in bloom

Starlike –
	the flesh spotted opal
	with its offal
	scent – maw
	open, black
	hole

Our dross
	we hope to life
	again, the energy
	an unsent
	prayer

Disguised,
	wearing a hat
	like the Cardiff Tower’s
	temple to oil—
	its subsurface
	tensions

The flower
	dies too,
	fossilized
	& confirmed
	all our
	intentions
	branch off
	til even the soil
	is new &
	now we may
	rest in nobody’s wetlands
	on the bed of tules


8-16-19 (hatred of august)

@ the sunset of the year
	you find that light is
	noticeable
	in its shortness

The flute sits disassembled
	at home, but
	plays better in
	the garden

There, the plants tire
	of the summer’s
	heat, only under
	the canopy
	is relief felt
	like a popsicle
	for the tonsils

It’s silly to hate a month
	even sillier to hate
	endings, which a month
	can represent

Though painful, we find
	ourselves at the end
	where we thought that
	amongst all the missing
	we too would be
	vanished

Delivered to the next
	the Airbnb
	cancelled
	oh well
	to a future of the same

8-19-19 (barge dream)
 In the dream
	I was helpless
	fighting
	for ur heart

In the dream
	of insecurity
	of the masculine
	will to destroy
	& regret it
	I felt love
	was contest

The limiting
	error of acting
	only on the seen—
	chemical agents
	& spirits
	take turns
	making believe

Some ways
	outta here
	beyond international
	waters, a continent
	not contingent
	on the currents
	of thermal
	sway, extraction’s
	exchange

Told u
	I have 2 personalities
	there is asleep
	and awake

In a box
	of night
	red from sun
	& angling
	toward some
	evaporate

I”m navigating
	a decoy wheel
	on the barge
	already off-course
	on a track
	automated by
	stars

The Earth’s poles
	prepping
	to switch<.>

8-19-19 (day on the barge / TripAdvisor coupon)

Onboard
	the Nautilus
	w/ rented binoculars

We trace the Newport
	harbor for hints
	of whale, smelling
	the cook’s
	grease from the vent

Bliss is spotted
	at a distance
	like a bottlenose
	mimicking
	a rising wave

Pursed
	lips, closed ears
	listening for the faint
	hum of the tuning fork
	pressed to jaw


8-28-19

To be determined
	by cohabitation
	sometimes called
	consumption

I type:
	there’s no shame
	in dropping out
	of everything

Leaving behind
	the worlds that have made you
	for more, better
	defined, worthy admission

One way to
	abandon molds—
	to forage
	the dissimilar

Startling
	to adapt to the noise
	wind brings
	thru bamboo thickets
	in an LA garden

Poetry feels
	extra shameful
	w/ you not around
	what did I do before
	we began helping each other
	thru this?

I spoke of
	wading thru mud-pools
	as if I didn’t know
	the sensation
	of being stuck

Lucky no
	life is wading
	no agenda
	but to pull
	what we can w/ us/

8-30-19

It pains
	to be left
	with the mote
	dug of ur insecurity
	knowing
	imprecise distances
	between brows

In his Duino’s
	Rilke wrote his
	fantasies into truth
	said we realize flowering
	& fading together

Underneath
	poetry (what we make
	unknowingly)
	may be
	a comfort
	closest
	to Glissant’s
	palliative for eternity
	that will to attempt

Sai mentioned
	life-force, said
	“it is what it sounds like”
	by many names

The first born
	& the last
	two coin flips
	by the same uncertain
	hands

9-4-19 (tandem running)

All distractions
	aside –
	generational discourses to keep up
	the hoarding of info #s cultural signifiers
	other people’s families issues –
	no, no other distractions
	to hold u back
	from what u
	were meant to do

To disrupt
	the perfectly ordinary
	to excel
	to save urself

A simple
	technological fix
	100% guaranteed
	to remove ur longings
	psychic obstacles
	to action
	to disrupt
	the previously scheduled
	programming

I wrote before
	against training
	training, for what?
	: for a consolidation
	of self into behaviors
	impulse reactions
	bent on containment

In the elusive vision
	of urself, do the starlings
	still dive in synch
	do govt jobs still drain
	& offer a pension
	has anything changed
	at all?

Anthills
	hold their own archives
	in scent
	& immediacy
	far-off the creak
	of the faucet warns
	of flood

Everything
	I hate abt the things I love
	of reality & its image
 	are the parts captured
	by capital

Bits held
	from magic
	I cull myself
	into another’s world
	notice the catalytic
	call
	to become another’s
	brief joy

9-6-19

Too quiet
	at the job I once desired

9-13-19 (full moon on friday the 13th)

Where u
	least expect, the past
	is hiding—the old classmate
	sitting at the table
	u serve
	its been almost a decade
	and no hello?

A ring
	at the door, those pearls
	of commitment
	foregone—
	the archive marbled
	dark & light
	w/ perspective’s loop

If consistency
	spells a person’s truth
	I am consistently not myself…

9-17-19 (to love others you must help them not see death)

At sunset
	the canon drops
	and I turn on like the pulse of a tube television	w/ a big wink
	all valley’s end, the rim of my cap an edge to this tunnel,
	of vision

Too many
	connections for one to handle – I am woven –
	tender foldings wrung thru devotion
	Emi’s gift-pact in a rosary bag,
	the bliss packed in a sacred thorn-apple

A child’s questioning

9-20-19 (cloisters)

Despite
	the lump in my throat I made an exit
	could have
	prayed longer for inside to save
	wore headphones to preserve
	an interior, the relief framed
	scene:

Alone
	locked out boy buys the seltzer
	water purified by horn
	hikes thru metro
	missed connection for the Cloisters
	he walks instead, lox bagel special

Like convos
	steered by certainty
	it all seems lopsided, apostolic—
	my duty to many-sided presence
	assured in change,
	the flower knowing it’s fruit

9-24-19 (poem for kids)

There is no
	right place or right time
	no city where the true life
	is happening
	always without you

Choice
	is simply carved
	of possibility,
	where Turtle Pond
	is where the turtles swim
	and just so happens
	ducks too

In a future
	where kids live &
	play dangerously close
	to the nettles, berate
	an out-of-touch fool
	on the metro, actually
	know what’s best – there will be
	no transition to a world
	for adults
	dull & course-plotted
	no need for a fantasy
	return to days of boredom
	nostalgia’s trick

Love waits
	in Love’s Pond, behind the rushes
	belly-up & blowing a kiss
	goodbye, goodbye – no time to waste
	when there are billionaires
	to kill & a billion hearts
	to mend/

9-26-19 (The key)

Being
	their key
	being to instrumentalize
	a moment’s
	mania
	U zoom to action
	(the worker’s ingest)
	on an overcast morning

Press
	pause
	stop the whole machine
	U unruly organ

Let loves
	dovetail, meet at their incongruence
	& meld a flavor
	U’ve never smelt before

10-2-19

As children
	of something, buffered from
	cellular mass – eat remedially
	from a TV dinner in front of TV
	“it’s hard not to think generationally,
	be a part of your generation”

I would love
	to be old someday	carry the heavy
	load of age	take considerable
	time each thought	none of this
	leaping to expediency—
	to know what my love has done
	how it grew old, too

Comfort
	may never come, to console
	me into the lull of certainty—
	every morning one should consider
	the chance of reprogramming
	catastrophe,
	a reintroduction to this one life

10-3/4-19

So it is true
	that yes indeed we have stopped talking
	about the content of life
	& begun, this very minute, talking about it’s frame
	that as such in this great worm of movement
	we have never aspired, in fact, to something outside the known
	yes, all the models of good have come before us
	& no, we never really saw them
	til this very moment, where the end of history
	& all it’s recombinant shapes and superstitions have been denied their conclusion
	when, I am speaking truly, something funny happened when I
	dropped my phone
	landing in the sink, splish splash,
	in the pool forming in the sink
	and the funny thing, when the phone fell,
	was that everything else
	all the contents
	seemed to fall too, all the money
	every job class degree
	all the friends I’d made, their contacts
	love letters, confessions of boredom,
	their threats & their threats
	of love, too, all the fearful
	stuff accumulated
	into the pretty frame
	of all we know
	& don’t


10-21-19 (one network may hide another)

It would appear
	that the spark of connection –
	its great vibration in ur pocket –
	is a private thing
	between parties, the tickle
	of a whisper

10-23-19 (orbweaver song)

These drawings
	are rather procedural, huh, they follow
	me, update changes, delete delete
	I keep flip-flopping
	on their attributes, can we
	describe me & what then
	of the world?

The 9 to 5’s
	hallucination, the visions of labor
	belonging to another,
	process their way into life
	like the duty of funeral rites
	what we carry on our shoulders
	pall-borne necks hung low
	our futures built
	underground

Control
	is loosed to the non-animates –
	its no wonder
	I upload time to a few
	repositories – transcribe the hand
	& its back – can we call it
	different from a personal
	cloud, archive of dreams
	I tinker w/ in
	meantime

This where
	the excess light of day
	the after works hours
	what I mean is
	the leftovers
	beyond the expense of sustenance

An example
	helps illustrate a point:
	between the branches of brush
	rhus ovata, a silver orbweaver constructs
	its web, a home, a terrain
	of work – the craft, one may say,
	takes time & energy & is
	more than mere noise

The orbweaver’s
	stabilimentum is a spiralled
	cloud of webby mess—nonsense
	in this economy,
	experts surmise
	it is the expression
	of silky excess
	making its way out
	an artful coincidence

What is
	the spider’s workflow, we ask
	when the web will be done

Crowds
	will ask, raise funds
	to find solutions, they
	pool resource
	& lend a pocket

To be but simple
	I draw out of need
	always out of time
	the succeeding page, a noise,
	approaches us
	blank/

11-22-19 (leaks)

There’s no organization
	no wondrous framework could
	be applied to bring control
	no big fix
	no flip of switch
	no, the faucet is clogged not by something
	only hidden, but something not even there—
	it’s clogged by another life
	of being faucet, one that never touched
	this one

To flow
	is not to get stuck, the bleakest
	days pass thru, neverminded,
	save for the residue left

My heart
	pumps more like a butter-churn
	than a faucet with this anxious
	schedule, I can’t sit still
	without someone else’s
	example, so I think what good
	is the introspection? anyways

Nothing but
	the spirit that animates all
	into chance, the trick that makes
	reunion special & bitter
	I relish the thought that a relationship
	can remain understandable,
	yet, never total, tied to the clock

I’m afraid.
	I want to have a stake in all this nonsense,
	I say, the tapwater is clear & drinkable—
	in the cup, it almost looks like its sparkling



12-25-19 (for Sai ❤️)

Inside
	the stonefruit’s a pit
	of pearl – the one u plucked
	from pantry to pocket –
	the ripest

U go
	outside
	& might miss the sunrise
	but find the starlings
	tracing their cloud
	instead

It’s lucky,
	to share in this world
	with u, ur magic way
	thru aisle or sulfur spring

These days, with u,
	the brightest layers
	of a blooming pearl


1-22-20

In one life
	a person does the thing they hate
	& grins, chooses the plot
	of dirt next to the power plant
	takes the advice
	of an enemy

To wince
	it off, I’m scared by
	the satisfaction of loss—
	though there is certainty
	to letting a balloon
	loose to wind

Restless
	in habit, the path of our skein
	is taut by worry

One day
	a new joy comes
	pawing at the lock
	asking, dependent,
	for commitment



1-29-20

How do
	seasons come to an end,
	resolve
	to turn the calendar page?

I pace
	around another’s
	archive
	shift papers, identify
	the thumb
	print of another time, inaccessibly mine


A wheel
	rolling
	over a Moreton fig
	— wary of the crush,
	we forget
	the relief of the seed


2-7-20

Waiting
	for the incision that precedes
	a promise of healing
	what could happen, now, in this dim room with only corners
	that would require you
	to live a different life?

There once
	was a close friend
	who shocked me w/ a story
	of their daydreams, so clear
	the color of their future
	life-like, ghostly before them

I feel distant
	in closed field, clothed
	w/ no mind’s eye
	why, before operation
	do I trust what is here today
	will be tomorrow?

When I
	wake, there, the disc-burnt image
	of a paralyzed dream, aging
	sits with me,
	disposed-of, I must move on—
	shake the Etch-a-Sketch & resume the next “blind
	contour” of the day

2-21-20 (curious cat meets re-paved backyard)

That quiet
	the light of the valleys bowl
	backyard reduced to Stone or
	how I use a wheel attached to steering wheel

Back to where
	I learned how to drive,9
	here am I sensitive?

Am I
	more sensitive where I was born?
	my old cat looks at me
	and I’m the ghost
	you can see his frame protruding, his blades make
	a catlike hieroglyph stalking
	down the stairs

I cried
	for him cleaning his unkept fur
	he could no longer reach, its all
	a dismal cloak for my fear of returning
	tomorrow a stranger

U process
	a different speed
	in a city with room for an ambling horse
	beside the sprawl’s mandated car
	density does not equal
	cruelty, but maybe complexity

Still,
	speaking to form
	fails to get close to experience
	& its harder-to-name shadow—
	I share a fraction of our fear
	with my parents, I work to calm their worries

I worry
	I’m making a mess
	dragging this long, weighty tail
	(a depressive fossil, it drones
	and erupts like a stadium audience)
	behind me,
	while

This house
	is cleaner than it ever was,
	save, for the cat


3-24-20 (three bedroom walk-up loft with all my creative class friends)

I am terrified
	of my old aspirations

Sprung
	outta that well—
	known all too well, in these times
	we tossed about frivolously,
	undefined & sticky
	as hell, an image dredged from
	the smell of hazelnut,
	dormitory musk, what have u

I desired
	the world’s platter
	all flat & tapered to size,
	comprehensible
	enough to be known by it

Speculation
	drives me,
	spun by those stories of reward
	all the while, I kept my life to myself
	as if it was mine
	to own
	& perhaps someday to sell


7-10-20 (after bodega dunes, we hid from the wind)

Ever a part
	of the puzzle w/ no corner pieces, all
	prognosis & relapse—trying hard
	to fail happily

There’s this
	unsolvable problem in my dreams
	it follows me thru that abundance
	like print in ultraviolet
	concentrated day-waiting
	– no deadline, no demand –
	mussels anchored to wave breakers
	must search for some mischief

Easy, u think, what’s
	there to do when u reach
	no worries? a beach sits
	so restlessly, always playing the edges

1 middle piece
	I missed, got pocketed
	washed & warped cardboard
	a whole sea stretched inside
	land ceded, kept but not lost
	to another hand dealt
